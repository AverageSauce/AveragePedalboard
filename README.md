This is just an example of how you can emulate a midi controller using an arduino or similar micro controller, I used a pi pico to add various features since my sketch didn't fit on a pro micro.

Please read it through carefully an customize any pin assignment, midi signal or any code in general since I'm an hobbyist and not a developer.
